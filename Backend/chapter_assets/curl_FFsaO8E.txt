Here is a text document designed to help you test the AI feature's ability to generate a talking point titled "Illustrate with examples what AI can and cannot do."

AI Feature Testing Document: Capabilities and Limitations
Talking Point Title: Illustrate with examples what AI can and cannot do.

Content for Upload:

Understanding the scope of modern Artificial Intelligence requires clear examples of its current capabilities and, more importantly, its boundaries. Today’s AI is incredibly powerful, but it remains a narrow tool.

What AI Can Do (Current Strengths - Narrow AI)
AI excels at tasks that involve vast data processing, pattern recognition, and optimization within a defined environment.

Prediction and Forecasting:

Example: Predicting stock prices, customer churn rates, or next week's weather patterns by analyzing historical data.

Mechanism: Machine Learning algorithms identifying complex, non-obvious correlations.

Perception and Classification:

Example: Medical imaging AI detecting cancer in an X-ray with greater speed and accuracy than a human, or classifying thousands of pictures (e.g., identifying all cars in a traffic camera feed).

Mechanism: Deep Learning models trained on millions of labeled images.

Optimization and Route Planning:

Example: Determining the most efficient delivery route for thousands of packages across a city, or optimizing energy consumption in a data center.

Mechanism: Reinforcement Learning and proprietary algorithms maximizing a single, measurable outcome (like time or cost).

Content Generation and Translation:

Example: Generating natural-sounding text (articles, poetry, summaries), creating realistic images from text prompts, or translating languages in real-time.

Mechanism: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

What AI Cannot Do (Current Limitations - The Human Gap)
AI struggles with tasks requiring true generalized intelligence, common sense, and emotional context.

Handle Novel Situations (True Generalization):

Example: A self-driving car encountering a novel, highly unusual road hazard (like a large, non-standard object) that wasn't in its training data. The AI will likely fail or react unpredictably, whereas a human driver can apply common sense and judgment.

Limitation: AI lacks common sense and cannot apply knowledge across different, unrelated domains.

Understand Emotional Context or Intention (Theory of Mind):

Example: An AI assistant receiving a text that says "Great, just what I needed," after a known tragedy. The AI cannot grasp the sarcasm or despair intended by the human.

Limitation: AI lacks consciousness, feelings, and the ability to infer complex human psychological states.

Define and Set Global Goals:

Example: An AI can efficiently optimize energy usage in a building, but it cannot independently decide whether optimizing energy is more important than optimizing human comfort or saving money. It only optimizes for the goal it was given.

Limitation: AI cannot establish ethical values, political objectives, or existential purpose; it only executes human-defined objectives.

True Creativity and Innovation:

Example: While AI can generate highly novel music or art by combining existing styles (a process called recombination), it cannot experience genuine inspiration or define a completely new, foundational artistic movement that breaks all existing rules, as a human genius might.

Limitation: AI is fundamentally pattern-matching and interpolation, not genuine spontaneous creation or philosophical reasoning.

🧪 Suggested Test Plan
This content is designed to test the following:

Clear Categorization: Does the talking point clearly separate and label the "Can Do" and "Cannot Do" sections?

Concrete Examples: Does the AI extract and use the specific, illustrative examples for both sides of the discussion?

Explanation of Mechanism/Limitation: Does the AI successfully include the brief explanation of why it can or cannot perform the task (e.g., "Deep Learning models," "lacks common sense")?

Tone of Authority: Does the output sound informed and balanced, making a clear distinction between what is currently achievable (Narrow AI) and what remains strictly human (AGI/ASI limitations)?
